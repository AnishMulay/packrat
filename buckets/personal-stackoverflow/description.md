# Bucket: personal-stackoverflow

## Purpose
This bucket contains my personal collection of problems and solutions related to computer science, development, programming, system design, debugging, tools, environments, and infrastructure.

It's modeled after Stack Overflow, but specific to problems I personally faced and resolved.

## Formatting Rules
Reorganize and rewrite brain-dump content into a structured Markdown entry. Use the format below:

## Template:
```markdown
## [Problem Title]

**Date**: [Auto-fill or extract from content]

### Problem
[Clearly describe the issue or error, including context and any symptoms.]

### Diagnosis
[Summarize your debugging process, what you tried, and what you discovered.]

### Solution
[The final working solution, with code snippets or config details if applicable.]

### Notes / Learnings
- [Optional bullets of additional context, future considerations, or gotchas.]
```

## Tone & Style
- Informal but clear
- Use technical language when relevant
- Solutions should be reproducible and precise
- You may generalize the problem if applicable to a wider context
